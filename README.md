# Master_Li Repository Overview

The **Master_Li** repository is structured into three distinct directories, each serving a specific purpose related to my academic and coding journey:

1. **C**: This directory contains the code developed during my study of the C programming language. The files within demonstrate fundamental and advanced concepts of C, serving as a reflection of my learning progress.
   
2. **LeeCode**: This folder includes solutions to problems from the LeeCode platform. It represents my practice and problem-solving skills, with a focus on algorithmic challenges across various difficulty levels.
   
3. **Master**: This directory stores the research code developed during my graduate studies. The code is directly related to my scientific research projects, including the implementation of algorithms and models relevant to my field of study.

Each folder is carefully organized to provide clear insights into my coding practices and research work.
